        <h2>What is Three.js?</h2>
        <p>
          Three.js allows the creation of GPU-accelerated 3D animations using JavaScript as part of a website without relying on proprietary browser plugins. This is possible due to WebGL, a low-level graphics API created specifically for the web. Before WebGL, rendering complex 3D graphics was limited in the web.

        <p>
          Three.js was originally written in ActionScript, but transitioned to JavaScript in 2009. The creator, Ricardo Cabello, believed JavaScript offered improved platform independence. The source code is available on GitHub, with over 1500 users contributing to the project.
